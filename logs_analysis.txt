Analysis of latest test failure logs:

The logs show the test is still failing with:
- Expected Deposited: $878.79, Actual: $0.00
- Expected Realized: $23.65, Actual: $0.00  
- Expected Unrealized: $14.86, Actual: $0.00
- Expected Movement Counter: 16, Actual: 0

Key issues identified:
1. No snapshots found in Collections.Snapshots.Items (count = 0)
2. Import appears successful but snapshots are not being created
3. The comprehensive logging shows all financial values are zero

This suggests the snapshot creation pipeline is not working despite the import being successful. The issue appears to be that while the CSV data is imported into the database, the reactive snapshot system is not creating the corresponding snapshots that the test validation relies on.

Need to investigate why snapshots are not being created after successful import.
