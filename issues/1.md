## Failing Job: Platform Integration Tests ([Job Log](https://github.com/DarioAlonsoCerezo/Binnaculum/actions/runs/17614789768/job/50045533709))

### Problem Summary
The job fails with this error:

```
error MSB4057: The target "XamlPreCompile" does not exist in the project. [D:\a\Binnaculum\Binnaculum\src\Tests\Core.Platform.Tests\Core.Platform.Tests.fsproj::TargetFramework=net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0]
```

This occurs because the F# test project `Core.Platform.Tests.fsproj` is configured or referenced in a way that triggers MSBuild to look for XAML-related build targets, which are not available for F# projects.

---

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Run the Platform Integration Tests workflow.
2. Observe the build failure in the log.

## Root Cause
- The F# test project is being built with XAML-related MSBuild targets (such as `XamlPreCompile`). These are only provided for C#/VB projects that use XAML (WPF/UWP/MAUI), not F#.
- This is typically caused by importing the wrong SDK in the project file, or referencing packages or targets related to XAML/Maui/WinUI/WPF in an F# project.

## Suggested Fix
1. **Edit `src/Tests/Core.Platform.Tests/Core.Platform.Tests.fsproj`:**
    - Ensure the project file does NOT import `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.WindowsDesktop`, `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Maui`, or any other SDK that brings in XAML targets.
    - At the top of the file, it should look like:
      ```xml
      <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
      ```
    - Remove any of these properties if present:
      ```xml
      <UseWPF>true</UseWPF>
      <UseWinUI>true</UseWinUI>
      <UseMaui>true</UseMaui>
      ```
    - Remove package references to XAML/WinUI/Maui/WPF libraries if not required by the F# project.
2. **If XAML testing is needed:**
    - Move XAML tests to a C# test project instead.

### Acceptance Criteria
- The F# test project builds and runs in CI without errors.
- No XAML/Maui/WPF/WinUI-related imports or references remain in the F# test project unless strictly necessary (and supported).
- Job passes in GitHub Actions.
