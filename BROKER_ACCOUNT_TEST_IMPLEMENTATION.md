# BrokerAccount Creation Test Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds a new test method `ExecuteBrokerAccountCreationTestAsync` to the Core.Platform.MauiTester project that validates creating a new BrokerAccount and verifying proper snapshot generation.

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
1. **TestRunner.cs** - Added new test method following the exact same pattern as existing `ExecuteOverviewTestAsync`
2. **MainPage.xaml** - Added green "Run BrokerAccount Creation Test" button  
3. **MainPage.xaml.cs** - Added event handler and refactored common test execution logic

### Test Flow
The new `ExecuteBrokerAccountCreationTestAsync` method performs these steps:

1. **Initialize MAUI Platform Services** - Verifies platform services are available
2. **Overview.InitDatabase()** - Initializes the database system
3. **Overview.LoadData()** - Loads all data including brokers and currencies
4. **Wait for Collections** - Allows 300ms for reactive collections to populate
5. **Find Tastytrade Broker** - Searches Collections.Brokers.Items for "Tastytrade" broker
6. **Create BrokerAccount** - Calls Creator.SaveBrokerAccount(brokerId, "Trading")  
7. **Verify Single Snapshot** - Confirms Collections.Snapshots.Items.Count == 1
8. **Verify Snapshot Type** - Confirms snapshot.Type == OverviewSnapshotType.BrokerAccount

### Key Features
- **Pattern Consistency**: Follows exact same structure as existing ExecuteOverviewTestAsync
- **Error Handling**: Uses ExecuteStepAsync for actions and ExecuteVerificationStepAsync for assertions
- **Progress Feedback**: Provides detailed step-by-step progress updates via progressCallback
- **Type Safety**: Properly validates snapshot type using OverviewSnapshotType enum
- **UI Integration**: Adds second test button with green background for visual distinction

## Testing Instructions

### To test this implementation on a real device/emulator:

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   dotnet build src/Tests/Core.Platform.MauiTester/Core.Platform.MauiTester.csproj -f net9.0-android
   ```

2. **Deploy to Android device/emulator:**
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project src/Tests/Core.Platform.MauiTester/Core.Platform.MauiTester.csproj -f net9.0-android
   ```

3. **In the app:**
   - First run "Run Overview Test" to initialize the system
   - Then run "Run BrokerAccount Creation Test" to test the new functionality
   - View test details to see step-by-step execution results

### Expected Results
- All 8 test steps should pass
- Test should successfully find "Tastytrade" broker
- Should create a new BrokerAccount with account number "Trading"  
- Should generate exactly 1 snapshot of type BrokerAccount
- UI should show green checkmarks for all completed steps

## Code Quality
- ✅ Follows existing code patterns exactly
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging
- ✅ Type-safe snapshot verification  
- ✅ Minimal code changes (surgical approach)
- ✅ Comprehensive progress reporting
- ✅ Built and compiled successfully for Android target
