Analyzing the latest logs to understand the remaining issue:

From the logs provided in comment 3341493912, I need to:
1. Download and examine the latest log file
2. Identify what's still failing in the OptionsImportIntegrationTest
3. Determine if the ReactiveTargetedSnapshotManager call is working
4. Check if option trades are being retrieved and processed correctly
5. Verify if the expected vs actual values are now matching

Key areas to investigate:
- Are option trades being retrieved during snapshot calculations?
- Is the expiration logic working with the correct dates?
- Are the expected test values correct based on the CSV data?
- Is there still a mismatch in realized vs unrealized calculations?
