    /// Mirrors Core.Platform.MauiTester's "RunBrokerAccountDepositReactiveTestButton" test.
    ///
    /// This test validates:
    /// 1. Database initialization completes successfully
    /// 2. BrokerAccount creation triggers Accounts_Updated and Snapshots_Updated signals
    /// 3. Deposit movement creation triggers Movements_Updated and Snapshots_Updated signals
    /// 4. Account is correctly added to Collections.Accounts
    /// 5. Movement is added to Collections.Movements
    /// 6. Snapshots are recalculated with deposit included
    ///
    /// The test uses signal-based verification instead of timing-based assertions,
    /// making it robust and portable across platforms. This is a two-phase test:
    /// - Phase 1: Create account and wait for account signals
    /// - Phase 2: Create deposit and wait for movement signals
