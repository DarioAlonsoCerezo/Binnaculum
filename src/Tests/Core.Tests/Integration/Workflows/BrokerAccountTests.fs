    /// 1. Database initialization completes successfully
    /// 2. BrokerAccount creation triggers Accounts_Updated and Snapshots_Updated signals
    /// 3. Account is correctly added to Collections.Accounts
    /// 4. Snapshot is automatically calculated and added to Collections.Snapshots
    ///
    /// The test uses signal-based verification instead of timing-based assertions,
    /// making it robust and portable across platforms.
