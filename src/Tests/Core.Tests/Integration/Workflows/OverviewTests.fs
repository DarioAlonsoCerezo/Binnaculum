    /// Mirrors Core.Platform.MauiTester's "Overview Reactive Validation" test.
    ///
    /// This is the single comprehensive test that validates:
    /// 1. Database initialization loads brokers, currencies, and tickers reactively
    /// 2. LoadData() fires Accounts_Updated and Snapshots_Updated signals
    /// 3. Collections contain expected data: Brokers, Currencies, Tickers, and Snapshots
    ///
    /// The test uses signal-based verification instead of timing-based assertions,
    /// making it robust and portable across platforms.
