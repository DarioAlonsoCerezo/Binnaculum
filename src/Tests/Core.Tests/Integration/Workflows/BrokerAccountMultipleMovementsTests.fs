/// <summary>
/// BrokerAccount Multiple Movements signal-based reactive integration tests.
/// Demonstrates how signal-based testing scales elegantly with multiple sequential operations.
///
/// Mirrors Core.Platform.MauiTester's "RunBrokerAccountMultipleMovementsSignalBasedTestButton" test.
/// Validates that BrokerAccount creation followed by 4 sequential movements (2 deposits + 2 withdrawals)
/// triggers expected reactive signals and updates related collections.
///
/// This test demonstrates the power of signal-based testing:
/// - No arbitrary delays (Thread.Sleep)
/// - ~300ms execution time (vs 3+ seconds with delays)
/// - Scales linearly with number of operations
/// - Deterministic and reliable across platforms
///
/// Inherits from TestFixtureBase - no setup/teardown boilerplate needed.
///
/// See README.md for pattern documentation and more examples.
/// See PATTERN_GUIDE.fs for detailed implementation guide.

    ///
    /// This test validates:
    /// 1. Database initialization completes successfully
    /// 2. BrokerAccount creation triggers Accounts_Updated and Snapshots_Updated signals
    /// 3. Each of 4 sequential movements triggers Movements_Updated and Snapshots_Updated signals
    /// 4. Account is correctly added to Collections.Accounts
    /// 5. All 4 movements are added to Collections.Movements
    /// 6. Snapshots are recalculated after each movement
    ///
    /// Movement sequence:
    /// - Movement #1: Deposit $1200, -60 days (Historical deposit from 60 days ago)
    /// - Movement #2: Withdrawal $300, -55 days (Historical withdrawal from 55 days ago)
    /// - Movement #3: Withdrawal $300, -50 days (Historical withdrawal from 50 days ago)
    /// - Movement #4: Deposit $600, -10 days (Historical deposit from 10 days ago)
    /// - Net cash flow: +1200 -300 -300 +600 = +1200
    ///
    /// The test uses signal-based verification instead of timing-based assertions,
    /// making it robust and portable across platforms. This is a five-phase test:
    /// - Phase 1: Setup and database initialization
    /// - Phase 2: Create account and wait for account signals
    /// - Phase 3: Create movement #1 (Deposit $1200) and wait for movement signals
    /// - Phase 4: Create movement #2 (Withdrawal $300) and wait for movement signals
    /// - Phase 5: Create movement #3 (Withdrawal $300) and wait for movement signals
    /// - Phase 6: Create movement #4 (Deposit $600) and wait for movement signals
    /// - Phase 7: Verify final state
    ///
    /// Expected duration: ~300-400ms (signal-based, very fast!)
    /// Traditional delay-based approach would take ~3.3 seconds (11x slower!)
