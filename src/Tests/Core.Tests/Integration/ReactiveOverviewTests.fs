    /// 1. Database initialization loads brokers, currencies, and tickers reactively

    /// 3. Collections contain expected data: Brokers, Currencies, Tickers, and Snapshots

    /// The test uses signal-based verification instead of timing-based assertions,
    /// making it robust and portable across platforms.
