In certain circumstances, IBUK routes the fractional portion of your order to an affiliate, which may execute the fractional portion of the order as principal. In such circumstances, this is indicated by the codes associated with the trade. If an IBUK affiliate acts as principal in executing any fractional share portion of your order, the order will be executed at the price displayed for the opposite side of the NBBO from your order (the offer if you are buying and the bid if you are selling) at the time of execution. If an IBUK affiliate is acting as riskless principal in connection with filling the fractional share portion of your order, the affiliate will execute the fractional share portion of your order at the price it receives for the execution of the whole share."
