# Reactive Collections Subscriptions Logging - ADDED

## Overview
Added comprehensive logging to `ReactiveTestVerifications.cs` to trace all reactive collection subscription changes and signal emissions. This will help diagnose why signals are not being received by the test wait mechanism.

## What Was Added

### 1. **Subscription Initialization Logging** (in `StartObserving()`)
- Added log when starting observation: `📡 Starting observation of all reactive collections...`
- Added individual subscription confirmation logs for each collection:
  - `✓ Subscribed to Overview.Data stream`
  - `✓ Subscribed to Collections.Currencies stream`
  - `✓ Subscribed to Collections.Brokers stream`
  - `✓ Subscribed to Collections.Tickers stream`
  - `✓ Subscribed to Collections.Snapshots stream`
  - `✓ Subscribed to Collections.Accounts stream`
  - `✓ Subscribed to Collections.Movements stream`
- Added error handlers to each subscription to log any stream errors
- Added completion handlers to log when streams complete
- Final confirmation: `✅ All collection subscriptions established successfully`

### 2. **Collection Change Logging** (in `RecordEmission()`)
- Added log for every collection change detected: `🔔 Collection change detected from '{streamName}': {emissionDetails}`
- Includes the emission details so we can see what's actually coming from the collections
- **This is critical**: If no logs appear here during the account creation, it means the collections are NOT emitting changes

### 3. **Signal Reception Logging** (in `SignalReceived()`)
- Added log when a signal is received: `📨 Signal received: '{signal}' | Total received so far: {count}`
- Added log when all expected signals are received: `✅ All expected signals received! Setting completion.`
- Added detailed status log if waiting for more signals:
  ```
  ⏳ Waiting for more signals. Expected: [list], Received: [list], Missing: [list]
  ```

### 4. **Signal Expectation Logging** (in `ExpectSignals()`)
- Added log when expectations are set up: `🚀 Expecting signals: [signal1, signal2, ...]`
- Added log if all signals already received: `✅ All signals already received before ExpectSignals completed!`
- Added log for ready state: `⏳ Waiting for signals... TaskCompletionSource created`

## Log Format
All logs use the `[RxTest]` prefix to make them easily filterable in the debug output.

Example log flow:
```
[RxTest] 📡 Starting observation of all reactive collections...
[RxTest] ✓ Subscribed to Collections.Accounts stream
[RxTest] ✓ Subscribed to Collections.Snapshots stream
[RxTest] ✅ All collection subscriptions established successfully
...
[RxTest] 🚀 Expecting signals: Snapshots_Updated, Accounts_Updated
[RxTest] ⏳ Waiting for signals... TaskCompletionSource created
[RxTest] 🔔 Collection change detected from 'Accounts': ...
[RxTest] 📨 Signal received: 'Accounts_Updated' | Total received so far: 1
[RxTest] ⏳ Waiting for more signals. Expected: Snapshots_Updated,Accounts_Updated, Received: Accounts_Updated, Missing: Snapshots_Updated
```

## Debugging Strategy

When you run the test again, look for these key indicators:

1. **Check if subscriptions are created:**
   - Look for: `✅ All collection subscriptions established successfully`
   - If missing: Subscriptions failed to initialize

2. **Check if collection changes are occurring:**
   - Look for: `🔔 Collection change detected from 'Accounts':`
   - If missing: Collections are NOT emitting changes when SaveBrokerAccount is called
   - If present: Collections ARE emitting, but signals aren't being created

3. **Check if signals are being created:**
   - Look for: `📨 Signal received:`
   - If present: Signal mechanism is working
   - If missing: Either `SignalReceived()` calls aren't reaching this code, or they're being called before `ExpectSignals()`

4. **Check if wait mechanism is working:**
   - Look for: `⏳ Waiting for signals...` followed by received signals
   - If timeout happens after this: Signals are being received but TCS isn't completing

## Next Steps

After running the test with this logging:

1. **If you see NO `🔔 Collection change detected` logs:**
   - Problem: Collections are not emitting changes
   - Solution: Need to investigate why `Collections.Accounts.Connect()` isn't notifying
   - Check if `.Connect()` was never called on the source collection

2. **If you see `🔔 Collection change detected` but NO `📨 Signal received` logs:**
   - Problem: Signals aren't being recorded
   - Solution: Check if `EmitSignalsForStreamActivity()` is working properly or if manual `SignalReceived()` calls are happening

3. **If you see `📨 Signal received` but test still times out:**
   - Problem: TCS isn't being completed even though signals arrive
   - Solution: Check the signal matching logic in `AllExpectedSignalsReceived()`

4. **If you see `✅ All expected signals received!` followed by timeout:**
   - Problem: TCS is being set, but `WaitForAllSignalsAsync()` isn't detecting it
   - Solution: May indicate threading issue with Task.WhenAny
